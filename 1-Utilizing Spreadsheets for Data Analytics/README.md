# Business Sales & Performance Analysis

This project aims to provide comprehensive analytical insights on the company's sales and operational performance, focusing on key trends and comparisons that can drive strategic decisions. The 'Overview' sheet will serve as a central dashboard, offering visualized data and meaningful insights.

Specifically, analyze:
- Monthly sales trends to identify patterns and seasonal variations.
- Online vs. non-online orders to assess customer preferences and sales distribution.
- Delivery performance trends, tracking the gap between order date and shipping date for operational efficiency.
- Top-performing salespeople based on revenue and volume.
- Leading countries in terms of sales, helping target market expansion strategies.
- Major sales reasons, uncovering drivers behind successful transactions.

By leveraging these data points, the project will deliver actionable intelligence, helping the business optimize sales strategies, improve logistical operations, and enhance overall performance.
