# Adventure Works Sales Dashboard using PowerBI

In this project, I was working with the Adventure Works Sales Orders dataset, which contains multiple sheets covering Sales Orders, Employees, Territory, and Sales Reasons data. The goal was to extract meaningful insights into business performance and prepare an interactive, user-friendly dashboard in PowerBI.
