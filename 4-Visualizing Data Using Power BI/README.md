# Adventure Works Sales Dashboard using PowerBI

In this project, I was working with Adventure Works Sales Orders dataset, which contains multiple sheets covering Sales Orders, Employees, Territory, and Sales Reasons data.  

The goal was to extract meaningful insights into business performance and prepare an interactive, user-friendly dashboard with PowerBI.

### Key Business Questions:

•  How business performed over the year in terms of revenue and the number of sales orders?  
•  What are the trends in orders received from each sales channel, and which channel has generated the most revenue over time?  
•  How efficiently is the company delivering products to customers?  
•  How much revenue and how many sales orders have been received from each country, and which country has performed the best?
