## Summary of the Insights

**Retention & Churn Trends:**  
- 88% retention after 6 weeks, but most churn happens in Weeks 1 & 2.  
- December cohorts (Dec-07, Dec-21, Dec-28) show high retention, while early November cohorts have the lowest retention (85%).  
- Churn rate starts increasing after Jan-04, signaling potential issues.
 
**Recommended Actions:**  
- Strengthen onboarding & early engagement to reduce initial churn.  
- Analyze December cohorts to replicate successful strategies.  
- Address user engagement challenges in lower-performing cohorts.  
- Leverage holiday-driven campaigns beyond seasonal spikes.
