## RFM Segmentation Dashboard

Customer segmentation is sorting your customers into groups who are similar, so we can treat them uniquely by the groups they are assigned. RFM stands for: how recently they bought (R), how often (F), and how much they spend (M). By doing this, we can find out who are the best customers, how to engage those customers who haven't shopped in a while, and make marketing campaigns better.

In this project, I analyzed the RFM dataset containing customer invoice details, including purchase timing, product selection, quantity, and spending. From this data, I derived insights into customer segments, their buying habits, and provided recommendations for optimizing engagement with each group.
