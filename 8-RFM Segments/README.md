# RFM Segmentation

Customer segmentation is sorting your customers into groups who are similar, so we can treat them uniquely by the groups they are assigned. RFM stands for: how recently they bought (R), how often (F), and how much they spend (M). By doing this, we can find out who are the best customers, how to engage those customers who haven't shopped in a while, and make marketing campaigns better.

In this project, I analyzed the RFM dataset containing customer invoice details, including purchase timing, product selection, quantity, and spending. From this data, I derived insights into customer segments, their buying habits, and provided recommendations for optimizing engagement with each group.

## Conclusions
 
Customers are categorized based on Recency (last purchase date), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary value (total spending) to better understand their engagement levels.
The most valuable customers have high spending frequency and recent purchases, making them ideal for loyalty and premium offers.

High-Value vs. At-Risk Groups:
- Top customers contribute significantly to revenue—focusing on retaining them through personalized offers, VIP benefits, and exclusive discounts can boost retention.
- At-risk and inactive customers require re-engagement strategies, such as targeted email campaigns or time-sensitive promotions.

Strategic Actions:
- Implement reward programs for high-value customers to increase loyalty and lifetime value.
- Develop re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers, offering incentives to encourage repeat purchases.
- Identify potential opportunities to upsell and cross-sell based on past purchase behaviors.
