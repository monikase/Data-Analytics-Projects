Full Analysis: [A\B Test Analysis](https://github.com/TuringCollegeSubmissions/msedui-MAT2.4.6/blob/5114afa5435ae80b41ab33494b2c67d5bfab4442/A%5CB%20Test%20Analysis.md)  

### Summary

A fast-food chain tested three marketing campaigns (Promotion 1, 2, and 3) for a new menu item across different locations, tracking sales for four weeks. The goal was to identify the most effective campaign with statistically significant results.

The analysis involved pairwise t-tests between the three promotions, using a 99% confidence level to account for multiple comparisons.

#### Key Findings:

- Promotion 1 vs. Promotion 2: **A statistically significant difference in mean sales was found, favoring Promotion 1. The effect size was large.**
- Promotion 1 vs. Promotion 3: **No statistically significant difference in mean sales was observed.** The effect size was medium.
- Promotion 2 vs. Promotion 3: **A statistically significant difference in mean sales was found, favoring Promotion 3. The effect size was large.**

#### Decision:

Based on the analysis, the **recommendation is to roll out Promotion 1** as the primary marketing campaign due to its statistically significant higher sales compared to Promotion 2. While Promotion 3 had the highest total sales overall, its difference from Promotion 1 wasn't statistically significant at the chosen confidence level.

#### Important Considerations:

- A cost analysis of implementing Promotion 1 is recommended.
- Further investigation into Promotion 3's performance is suggested.
- Ongoing monitoring of the chosen promotion's performance is crucial.
