# A Chess Question

### Project Goal

This Python code simulates a simplified chess game [Improved Version of Chess_Mini_Tasks](https://github.com/monikase/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/_11-Chess%20Assignment/Chess_Mini_Tasks.md), allowing users:

* **Manage Chess Pieces:** Add white and black chess pieces to specific positions in the board
* **Analyze Piece Movements:** Displaying all squares that a selected piece can atack
* **Generate Random Board Setup:** with one white and several `(<17)` black pieces.
* **Visualize the Board:** chosen pieces and highlighted squares
* **Interactive menu:** offers a command-line interface to perform these actions
