# Chess Assignment Project

---

This Python code simulates a simplified chess game, allowing users:

* **Manage Chess Pieces:** Add white and black chess pieces to specific positions in the board
* **Analyze Piece Movements:** Displaying all squares that a selected piece can atack
* **Generate Random Board Setup:** with one white and several `(<17)` black pieces.
* **Visualize the Board:** chosen pieces and highlighted squares
* **Interactive menu:** offers a command-line interface to perform these actions
