## Project Goals

The project aimed to answer the following key questions:
1. What are the dominant genres in 2020's top charts?
2. Are there specific audio features that consistently appear in popular tracks?
3. Can we identify distinct 'types' of hit songs based on their characteristics?

## Quick Summary Overview:

- Genre Diversity: **Pop and Hip-Hop/Rap** are dominant

The analysis indicates that hit songs generally exhibit the following characteristics:
- **High Energy & Danceability**: Popular tracks are typically upbeat and rhythm-driven.
- **Low Acousticness & Speechiness**: They tend to have clear instrumental and vocal clarity rather than raw, unfiltered sounds or spoken word.
- **Optimal Loudness**: Most popular songs are concentrated within a specific loudness range (-5 to -7 dB), suggesting an optimal listening volume.
- **Minimal Instrumentalness**: Hit songs are vocal-centric, with instrumental tracks being rare in the top charts.
