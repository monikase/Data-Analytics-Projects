### Goal of the Analysis

The primary goal is to identify the course characteristics most strongly linked to higher student enrollment and better ratings on Coursera.


### Key Questions

1. Which course characteristics (such as difficulty level, certificate type, organization, or topics) show the strongest correlation with high student enrollment and ratings?
2. How can Coursera leverage these insights to prioritize future course development, optimize existing content, and refine marketing strategies?


### Summary of Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights into what makes a course successful on the Coursera platform:

- **Beginner Tech Courses Dominate:** Courses in high-demand fields like Data Science and IT attract the vast majority of students.
- **"Mixed" Difficulty Earns Higher Ratings:** While beginner courses have more students, "Mixed" difficulty courses receive significantly higher ratings, indicating that a blend of introductory and advanced content is highly valued.
- **Brand Reputation is a Major Draw:** Courses from prestigious universities and major tech companies attract a disproportionately high number of students, underscoring the importance of brand trust.
- **High Ratings Don't Equal High Enrollment:** There is no significant correlation between course ratings and enrollment numbers. A course's popularity is driven more by its topic and brand recognition than by its rating alone.
