##E-Commerce Performance & Funnel Analysis

This project focuses on understanding user behavior and purchase dynamics within an e-commerce web platform. Using event-level
data collected from site interactions, the analysis explores:
● How customers move through the purchase funnel
● How device type and geography influence behavior
● How browser updates may impact conversion
● How new versus returning users contribute to overall sales
The objective is to support product decision-making by identifying patterns, diagnosing potential issues, and highlighting
opportunities for growth or optimization.
Through a series of SQL-driven investigations and Power BI visualizations, the project provides a comprehensive view of the
platform’s performance during the period from November 2020 to January 2021.
