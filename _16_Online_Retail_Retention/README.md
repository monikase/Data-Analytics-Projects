# Online Retail Retention Analysis 

#### Goal

To analyze customer purchasing behavior and measure customer retention using Cohort Analysis.  

#### Methodology  

The analysis segments customers into monthly cohorts based on their first purchase `CohortMonth` and tracks their subsequent activity over time `CohortIndex`. Key metrics calculated across these cohorts include:  

- Customer retention rates.
- Average purchase quantity.

#### Insight

- Even though retention declines (fewer returning customers), the customers who stay tend to buy in similar or slightly higher quantities, suggesting loyalty among active buyers.
