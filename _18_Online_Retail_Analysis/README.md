# Customer Retention & Revenue Analysis – Online Retail

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior in an online retail dataset with the goal of identifying **revenue drivers, retention patterns, and churn risk**.  
The analysis focuses on **customer lifecycle metrics**, **cohort-based retention**, and **RFM segmentation**, presented in **Power BI dashboard**.

---

## Business Questions
The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:
- How is revenue distributed between one-time and repeat customers?
- How does customer retention evolve over time?
- Where does early churn occur, and how significant is it?
- Which customer segments drive the majority of revenue?
- How much revenue is currently exposed to churn risk?

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Online Retail transactional dataset  
- **Period covered:** December 2010 – November 2011  
- **Granularity:** Invoice-level transactions  
- **Key fields:** CustomerID, InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, Revenue

---

## Key Metrics & Concepts
- **Total Revenue**
- **Average Revenue per Customer (ARPC)**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Repeat vs One-Time Customers**
- **Cohort Retention (% and counts)**
- **RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**
- **Revenue Exposed to Churn**

## Key Insights
- **Customer retention is the dominant revenue driver:**  
  Over **93% of total revenue** is generated by repeat customers.
- **Early churn is the largest opportunity:**  
  Only **~20–30% of customers** return after their first purchase.
- **Customer acquisition quality remains stable:**  
  Later cohorts are smaller but show comparable retention behavior.
- **Revenue is highly concentrated:**  
  High-value RFM segments represent a minority of customers but drive most revenue.
- **Revenue at risk is measurable:**  
  A meaningful share of revenue comes from churn-prone segments, highlighting the value of targeted retention strategies.

## Next Steps
Potential extensions of this analysis include:
- Identifying drivers of early churn (product mix, geography, pricing)
- Tracking RFM segment migration over time
- Evaluating retention by acquisition channel
- Measuring impact of targeted retention interventions
